    "## Objective\n",
    "In this assignment, you will learn how to build and train a decoder GPT-like model, which is ideal for generating text and other natural language processing tasks. By the end of this tutorial, you will understand the basics of preparing data, building the model architecture, training the model, and generating text based on learned patterns.\n",
    "## Introduction to GPT Models\n",
    "GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) models are decoder-only models trained using a causal language modeling objective. The primary goal is to predict the next token in a sequence given the previous tokens. During training, the model learns to generate output tokens autoregressively, allowing it to produce coherent and contextually relevant text based on the input prompt.\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "Decoder-Only Model: GPT models focus on generating text based on the input sequence, predicting one token at a time.\n",
    "Causal Language Modeling: The model is trained to predict the next token in a sequence, given the context of the previous tokens.\n",
    "Autoregressive Generation: The model generates text one token at a time, using the previously generated tokens as context.\n",
    "## GPT vs. ChatGPT\n",
    "Both GPT and ChatGPT are AI models developed by OpenAI, but they serve different purposes:\n",
    "GPT: A family of large-scale transformer-based language models for various NLP tasks, such as text generation, translation, and question-answering. GPT models generate responses based on the input text but do not maintain conversation history.\n",
    "ChatGPT: A fine-tuned version of GPT, specifically designed for conversational AI applications. ChatGPT maintains conversation history and generates contextually relevant responses, making it suitable for chatbot-like interactions.\n",
    "## Assignment Tasks\n",
    "Prepare the environment and dataset for training a GPT-like model.\n",
    "Build the model architecture, focusing on the self-attention mechanism.\n",
    "Train the model using a dataset of your choice.\n",
    "Use the trained model to generate text based on a given prompt.\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes\n",
    "By completing this assignment, you will gain hands-on experience in building and training a decoder GPT-like model for text generation. You will understand the key concepts of GPT models, including causal language modeling and autoregressive generation, and learn how to apply these concepts in a practical setting."

It initializes the embedding layer, positional encoding, transformer encoder layers, and a linear layer (`lm_head`) for generating logits over the vocabulary.\n",
